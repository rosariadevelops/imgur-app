# React Imgur Gallery App

A simple web app that allows one to browse the Imgur gallery using the Imgur API. Users can filter images via the section, sort and window parameters. ReactJS, Redux, CSS Modules and Express (API proxy). Built in one week.

Using only functional and hook components, minimal route rendering and dynamic API calls based on dropdown filters. Infinite scroll will load more images from the API.
